<h2><a id="mainstart" name="mainstart"></a>Accessibility and Standardisation</h2>

<p>People with disabilities have the same <a href="additionalinfo.html#main">rights</a> to contribute to society and economy as people without disabilities. 
For this reason, equal access to goods and services by people with disabilities is essential 
for their participation in society without discrimination. 
Products and services need to be <strong>accessible</strong>, in other words, 
<q>individuals with disabilities can access and use them as effectively as people who don&rsquo;t have disabilities</q>.
<!-- From Slatin &amp; Rush: Maximum Accessibility, p. 3 --> 
<a href="additionalinfo.html#standards">Standards</a> can contribute to the accessible design of products and services in several ways, 
for example, by defining accessibility requirements, by providing guidance on development or design methods, or by providing evaluation methodologies. 
Note that we use the phrase &ldquo;people with disabilities&rdquo; in a very wide sense: 
elderly persons also experience impairments but they do not necessarily consider themselves as people with disabilities.
</p>

<p>Most standards for products and services have not addressed the needs of persons with disabilities. 
Moreover, organisations that represent people with disabilities and elderly users are rarely involved in standardisation, 
especially at a European level. For this reason, the Stand4All consortium developed two training courses:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a course aimed at organisations that represent <strong>people with disabilities and elderly users</strong>, 
    in order to increase their effective participation in the standardisation process; and
  </li>
  <li>another course aimed at <strong>members of standardisation committees</strong> in order to increase 
    their awareness and knowledge of accessibility issues faced by persons with disabilities.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>More information is available on the <a href="training.html">trainings page</a>.</p>
<p><acronym title="European Committee for Standardization">CEN</acronym>/<acronym title="European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation">CENELEC</acronym> Guide 6 
is a document with guidance for standardisation committees on how to take into account the needs of people with disabilities 
when defining standards for products and services. This guide is used in several parts of the Stand4All training courses. 
A <a href="ftp://ftp.cencenelec.eu/EN/EuropeanStandardization/Guides/6_CENCLCGuide6.pdf"><acronym>PDF</acronym> version of Guide 6</a> is available on the <abbr>CEN</abbr>/<abbr>CENELEC</abbr> website.

  <h2><a id="mainstart" name="mainstart"></a>Stand4All: Introduction</h2>
  <p>Stand4All is a project that focuses on training </p>
  <ul>
    <li>for <strong>persons with disabilities</strong> to increase their effective
      participation in the <strong>standardisation process</strong> and</li>
    <li>for <strong>experts in standardisation</strong> to increase their awareness
      and knowledge of <strong>accessibility issues</strong> faced by persons
      with disabilities.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The project is a response to <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=626&amp;langId=en&amp;callId=173&amp;furtherCalls=yes">call
  for tenders VT/2008/002</a> by the European Commission's Directorate-General
  for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities. The call fits into
  the wider framework of the PROGRESS programme, which supports the
  implementation of the objectives in the European Union's <a
  href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=547&amp;langId=en">Social Agenda</a>.</p>
  
  <p>The project also fits into the framework of the <strong>European
  Disability Strategy</strong>. This strategy is built on three pillars:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>European <strong>anti-discrimination legislation</strong> and measures
      that provide access to individual rights,</li>
    <li><strong>eliminating barriers in the environment</strong> that prevent
      persons with disabilities from exercising their abilities, and</li>
    <li><strong>mainstreaming disability issues</strong> in the broad range of
      European Community policies which facilitate the active inclusion of
      persons with disabilities.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>According to the European Commission, standardisation is relevant to
  consumer rights:</p>
  
  <blockquote
  cite="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2007/com2007_0724en01.pdf">
    <p>Empowering consumers, including more vulnerable consumers with special
    needs or <strong>disabilities</strong>, setting rights and
    <strong>accessibility standards</strong>, and protecting them against risks
    and threats that they cannot tackle as individuals is a central goal of the
    consumer policy strategy.</p>

<p>The Stand4All project started in January 2009 and ran until 30 March 2010.</p>
<hr />
<p>This website is supported for under the European
Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (2007-2013). This
programme is managed by the Directorate-General for Employment, social affairs and
equal opportunities of the European Commission.
</p>
<p>It was established to financially support the implementation of the objectives of the
European Union in the employment and social affairs area, as set out in the Social
Agenda, and thereby contribute to the achievement of the Lisbon Strategy goals in these
fields.
</p>
<p>The seven-year Programme targets all stakeholders who can help shape the development
of appropriate and effective employment and social legislation and policies, across the
<acronym title="European Union">EU</acronym>-27, 
<acronym title="European Free Trade Association">EFTA</acronym>-<acronym title="European Economic Area">EEA</acronym>
